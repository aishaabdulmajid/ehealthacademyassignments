        <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. <strong><em>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.</em></strong><br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein <em>couldn’t</em> count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</strong><br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <strong>Until one day, you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <em>Each wrong</em> answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger.</strong><br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This is learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just <em>don’t</em> get it, yet.<br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
