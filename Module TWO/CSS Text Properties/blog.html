            <h3>Its Benefits</h3>
            <p>Ginger is a common folk treatment for upset stomach and nausea. There's evidence that it helps.<br>
              Ginger seems to aid digestion and saliva flow. Studies found that taking ginger could reduce nausea<br>
              and vomiting in some pregnant women. But pregnant women should be careful with ginger. Some experts<br>
              worry that it could raise the risk of miscarriage, especially in high doses. Ginger seems to help with<br>
              nausea caused by vertigo as well. There's mixed evidence about whether ginger helps with nausea caused<br>
              by motion sickness, surgery, or chemotherapy. Ginger does seem to help with painful periods. In one <br>
              study, more than 60% of women felt that ginger lessened pain.</p>

              <h3>Side Effects of Ginger<h3>
            <p> In small doses, ginger has few side effects. High doses of ginger, say, more than 5 grams a day, <br>
              increases the chances of side effects. Ginger on the skin may cause a rash. Consumption may cause:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Gas</li>
                <li> Heartburn </li>
                <li> Upset stomach</li>
                <li> Mouth irritation</li>
                </ul>

            <h> <em>28th August, 2020</em></h>
            <p>Calories, we all know can be dangerous to our bodies if taken in excess, but them, how many of us know <br>
            that they make up the bulk of most of our favorite delicacies? From frries, to pastries, to sweets, iced <br>
            creams, fast food,s beaverages, and so on. As much as we campaign against taking in calories in excess, <br>
            how many of us are actually able to curb them out of our day to day meeal consumption?

                <p> Contrary to popular belief, some calories are good for the body and are actually required for the <br>
                body's proper functioning. On the other hand, others are bad, and can cause harm if taken in excess.<br>
                </p>

              <h3> Effects of Low intake of Calories</h3>
              <p>Calories are critical when you're trying to lose weight, but low calorie diets eventually catch up to you.<br>
                 If you're eating less than 1,200 calories a day, you might experience negative side-effects. Your body begins<br>
                 to fight weight loss by lowering your metabolism and releasing hormones that make you hungry.

                <li> Reducing calories burns mass</li>
                <li> Fewer calories boosts hunger </li>

              <h3> Effects of Taking too much Calories </h3>
                <p> Weight gain is a major effect of eating too many calories. Your body needs enough calories to function, but <br>
                  when you take in more than your body uses, it stores the excess calories in the form of fat. Extra calories are <br>
                   mainly stored in the form of triglycerides, which, when elevated, places your heart health at risk. As with other <br>
                   lipids, too many triglycerides accumulate in your arteries, increasing the risk of your arteries becoming hard, <br>
                   stiff and narrow -- a condition known as atherosclerosis. Stiffening of the artery wall increases the risk of having <br>
                    a heart attack or stroke.

                <li> Too much calories form saturated fat </li>
                <li> Too much calories can lead to stroke </li>
