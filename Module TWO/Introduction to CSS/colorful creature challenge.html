        <p> The <em>LION</em> is awesome because it is one of the <strong>strongest</strong> animals in the animal kingdom.<br>
            It is also called the <strong>king of the jungle.</strong><br>
            Another trait lions are known for is their <strong>majestic</strong> nature.<br>
            An <em>interesting</em> quality they have is their adaptability. They can also travel a great distance without <strong>stress</strong></p>
