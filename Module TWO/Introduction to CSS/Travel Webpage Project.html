        <p> The ancient city of <strong>Kano</strong> is located in the Northern part of Nigeria. It has been <br>
            in existence since the pre-colonial era. <strong> Kano </strong> has 15 ancient city gates and several illegal <br>
            entrances commonly known as <em>Haure</em>.</p>

        <p> The predominant tribe in the city are <em>Hausas</em>. The dominant religion in the city is Islam, followed by<br>
            Christianity and traditional religion. Their occupation is mainly commerce and agriculture, perhaps the <br>
            reason the state is referred to as the Centre of Commerce. Asides being popular for their groundnut production, <br>
            they also produce other crops like rice, maize, millet, potatoes, onions and sorghum. </p>
